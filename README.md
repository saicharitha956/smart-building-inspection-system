The Smart Building Inspection System is an AI-powered application designed to automatically detect and analyze structural damages in buildings using images. The system helps engineers, inspectors, and authorities assess building health efficiently without manual inspection.

Using a custom-trained YOLOv8 deep learning model, the application identifies common building defects such as cracks, spalling, peeling, algae growth, and stains. It evaluates the severity of damage and generates inspection insights to support better maintenance and safety decisions.

The backend is built with Flask, secured using JWT authentication, and integrated with MongoDB to store inspection reports, images, damage categories, severity levels, and health scores. RESTful APIs enable seamless image uploads, real-time analysis, and automated report generation.

This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision and AI in civil infrastructure monitoring, improving accuracy, speed, and cost-effectiveness of building inspections.
